<p>duckmaze is a game about a duck that is in a maze.  The duck can move walls,
but only if there are no walls in the way (it makes sense when you try it).</p>

<p>It's a simple puzzle game which starts with easy levels but progresses to
some quite tricky ones.</p>

<p>The game includes a full level editor, so feel free to create your own and
send them in!</p>

<p style="color:red">NOTE: At the moment, duckmaze has no sound effects
or music.  This will be fixed soon!</p>

<h2>Getting duckmaze</h2>

<h3>Python and PyGame</h3>

<p>To run duckmaze, you will need to install Python and the PyGame library.
On Linux this should be a simple case of
<tt>apt-get install python-pygame</tt> or
<tt>yum install pygame</tt> or similar.</p>

<p>On Windows, you will need to download the relevant installers and install
them.</p>

<h3>Windows PC</h3>

<p>If you want to run duckmaze on a Windows PC (i.e. a normal computer),
download the file duckmaze-pc-XXX.zip from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=184166&package_id=214136">Sourceforge
download area</a>, and unzip it.</p>

<p>Double-click on duckmaze.py and hopefully the game will run.  If you have
problems, open a DOS or Cmd window, cd into the directory where you unzipped
duckmaze, and type <tt>python duckmaze.py</tt></p>

<h3>Linux PC</h3>

<p>Download the file duckmaze-pc-XXX.zip from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=184166&package_id=214136">Sourceforge
download area</a>, and unzip it.</p>

<p>cd to the directory where you unzipped the file, and type
<tt>./duckmaze.py</tt>.  Alternatively, try <tt>python duckmaze.py</tt></p>

<h3>GP2X</h3>

<p>If you have the excellent <a href="http://gp2x.co.uk/">GP2X</a> handheld
games console, first you need to make sure you have Python and the PyGame
library installed.  The easiest way to get these is to download both of
them as a single zip file.  There is a known-working version on the
mop(e)snake download page: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=179489&package_id=215400">pygame_gp2x</a>
but there may be more recent versions linked from here: <a href="http://wiki.gp2x.org/wiki/Pygame">http://wiki.gp2x.org/wiki/Pygame</a>.
You should unzip the file and copy the "python" directory over to the
root directory of your GP2X's sd card.</p>

<p>Now download the file duckmaze-gp2x-XXX.zip from the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=184166&package_id=214136">Sourceforge
download area</a> and unzip it on your PC, before
copying the unzipped directory across to your GP2X.  You should now be able
to choose "Games" in the GP2X menu, navigate to the directory you copied over,
and start the game by choosing "duckmaze".</p>

<h2>Playing duckmaze</h2>

<h3>PC</h3>

<p>Press any key to start, and use the arrow keys to control the duck.  Try to
get out of the maze, and don't forget you can move walls, but only if there
is not another wall in the way!</p>

<p>You can also use the good old fashioned O, P, Q, A key layout
you remember from your ZX Spectrum days.  You can also redefine the keys by
modifying the config file in ~/.duckmaze/config.  Figuring out the format of
that file is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<p>Press ESCAPE on the title screen to enter the menu, which allows
you to change the level you start at (once you have unlocked them) and turn the
music and sound effects on or off.  You can also go to the level editor from
this menu (see later).  Press ESCAPE during the game to pause or quit.</p>

<h3>GP2X</h3>

<p>Press any button to start, and use the joystick and/or the A, B, X and Y
buttons to control the duck.  Try to
get out of the maze, and don't forget you can move walls, but only if there
is not another wall in the way!</p>

<p>Press START on the title screen to enter the menu, which allows
you to change the level you start at (once you have unlocked them) and turn the
music and sound effects on or off.  You can also go to the level editor from
this menu (see later).  Press START during the game to pause or quit.</p>

<h2>Creating Levels</h2>

<h3>PC</h3>

<p>Press ESCAPE and choose 'Level editor' from the menu.  You can either create
a new level, or load one you have already created.</p>

<p>Once you have created or
loaded a level, you will see the level, and your cursor to add or remove
walls.  Move the cursor using the mouse or the arrow keys, and left-click
(or press RETURN) to add or remove a wall, and right-click (or press SPACE)
to move the start position of the duck.</p>

<p>When you are happy with your level, press ESCAPE to display the menu and
choose 'Save level'.  You can choose to save it as a new custom level, or
overwrite one you saved before.</p>

<p>Please send in your level designs to duckmaze-devel at
lists dot sourceforge dot net.  It would be great to see them, and if they're
tricky and/or interesting enough, they will appear in the next release!</p>

<p style="color: red;">NOTE: At the moment, there is no easy way to play the
levels you create.  They are saved in the levels directory inside the
duckmaze directory, and to play them you must rename them from 'custom_xxx'
to 'level_xxx'.  When you have done that, they will become part of the normal
game.  This will be fixed in a future version, so that you can play custom
levels directly.</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>duckmaze is written in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>,
using the <a href="http://www.pygame.org/">PyGame</a> library, which is a
convenient wrapper on the <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a>
libraries.</p>

<p>duckmaze's source code is stored in an SVN repository.  Make sure you
have the SVN command-line client (should be already installed on most
Linux distros, but will need to be installed on Windows), and type:</p>

<p><tt>svn co https://duckmaze.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/duckmaze/trunk
duckmaze</tt></p>

<p>To run, type:</p>

<p><tt>cd duckmaze</tt><br />
<tt>./duckmaze.py</tt></p>

<p>On Windows, the last line should be:</p>

<p><tt>python duckmaze.py</tt></p>

<p>Patches, suggestions and comments welcome!  Send them to our developers'
mailing list.</p>
