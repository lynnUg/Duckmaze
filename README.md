Duckmaze
========
Welcome to Duckmaze :-)
Duckmaze is a game about a duck that is in a maze and needs to get out of the maze. The duck can move walls, but only if there are no walls in the way (it makes sense when you try it).

It's a simple puzzle game which starts with easy levels but progresses to some quite tricky ones.

##- Installing packages

To run duckmaze, you will need to install Python(2.7.*) and the PyGame(1.9.2) library. 

On Linux this should be a simple case of apt-get install python-pygame or yum install pygame or similar.

On Windows, you will need to download the relevant [Python](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) [PyGame installer](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame)

On Mac , pip install hg+http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame

##- Potential Challenge

The Duckmaze currently has menu that is displayed only when the game is starting out at level 1 and when the game is paused. The current menus have a function that allows one to switch the music on and off . I would like to participants to extend the music function and add a music menu.
